**Connecting UGA students with other UGA students to get tedious tasks done — fast, easy, and student-powered.**

## 🚀 Project Overview

**BulldogButler** is a web platform that allows students at the University of Georgia to outsource everyday, time-consuming tasks (like note-taking, grocery pickup, furniture moving, etc.) to other students for a fee. It's like a task marketplace — built by Dawgs, for Dawgs.
